From top to bottom, the sandwich consists of a Hawaiian bun, honey smokehouse BBQ sauce, bacon with a brown sugar pepper blend, Colby-Jack cheese, grilled chicken, lettuce, and bun.</figcaption>

          <figcaption id="second-text">How do you like to eat your steak? For some it's nice and simple, with potatoes of some form and a side of sauce, maybe some green vegetables, or perhaps you prefer to throw some Asian flavours into the mix? However you like it, you can never have too many steak recipes. Here then are five steak recipes from Gordon Ramsay, from sauced dishes to sandwiches. You're sure to find something you like in amongst these.</figcaption>
